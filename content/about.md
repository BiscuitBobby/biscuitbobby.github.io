Hey guys, I go by my alias BiscuitBobby.
I’m an undergrad student pursuing a degree in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My primary expertise lies in backend development, but I’ve recently been getting into kernel development.

I hope you find something that catches your interest or helps you learn something new.
I’m always eager to explore new things and dive into anything that piques my interest.
